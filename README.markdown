An implementation of the HyperLogLog approximate cardinality estimation algorithm (as well as Linear Counting), as a Hive User-defined Aggregation Function (UDAF).

Relies on Clearspring's [stream-lib](https://github.com/clearspring/stream-lib) for implementation of the relevant algorithms.

See the original project's [Wiki](https://github.com/mlnick/hive-udf/wiki) for usage instructions.
